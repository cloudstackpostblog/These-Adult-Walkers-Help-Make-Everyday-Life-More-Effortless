                </p>
                <h2>Key Features and Benefits</h2>
                <p>
                    Here’s a closer look at what makes the Drive Steel Rollator stand out:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Durable Steel Frame</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built to last, the rollator’s steel frame can handle daily wear and tear. It offers superior support compared to aluminum alternatives, particularly for users who require additional durability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Comfortable Resting Spot</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Walking long distances can be tiring. That’s why this model features a padded seat and a curved backrest, ideal for relaxing during outdoor strolls or while waiting in line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Smooth Rolling Wheels</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With 6-inch wheels, the rollator handles both indoor flooring and outdoor sidewalks with ease. The wheels are non-marring, so there’s no need to worry about leaving marks inside your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Locking Hand Brakes</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Safety is non-negotiable. The loop-style hand brakes give users complete control, especially on inclines or uneven terrain. Simply squeeze to slow down or push down to lock the rollator in place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Easy Folding Mechanism</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transporting or storing the rollator is simple. It folds flat with minimal effort and fits easily into most vehicle trunks or closets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Adjustable Handle Height</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every user is different. The handle height is adjustable to ensure proper posture and comfort, helping to prevent strain during extended use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These features aren’t just bells and whistles; they’re essential functions that make this product one of the most reliable adult walkers we carry.
